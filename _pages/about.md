Abduljelili Popoola is a Ph.D. student in Applied Physics at University of South Florida. He obtained his Masters degree from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in 2020, where he applied perovskites materials for optoelectronics applications including photodetectors and supercapacitors. He is currently working on a joint computational experimental project between LAMSAT (Laboratory for Advanced Materials Science and Technology) and Computational Nanoscience group. The project focuses on computational predictions and experimental measurements of novel organic-inorganic ferroelectrics. Lately, I started working on accelerated molecular dynamics using artificicial neural network.
